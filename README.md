# Elasticity_Price_VS_Demand



This is a method how to calculate elasticity of a product if we have data of Price and Demand .

I have used SKLearn method Linear regression to do it so .




“How sensitive is Sales Demand, if product price changes?” “How much my sales will increase, if I lower my price?”

let's Understand the Theory Behind the Elasticity
There are 3 types of elasticity :
1> Inelastic : When the price changes have no effect on the sales demand       ,

                Elasticity Range : -1 to +1


2> Negative elasticity : price decrease our sales demand increase

     Generally speaking, demand will decrease when price increases, and demand will increase when price decreases.

     price and product are inversly proportional


                 Elasticity Range : less than -1



3> Positive elasticity : prices decrease, sales demand decreases. Or the opposite, when product prices increase, sales            demand increases.


price and product are proportional


                Elasticity Range : greater than +1
Price Elasticity of Demand : % change in quantity / % change in Price

Now you got it! ,
you can analyze and observe how sensitive it is the consumer sales demand of different products towards price changes in a sole marketplace.
